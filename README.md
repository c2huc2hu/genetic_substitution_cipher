Trying to breed an algorithm to break a substitution cipher. 

I'm planning to use three stages: 
1. Frequency attack: Breed some genomes for which the frequency distribution is close to that of English
2. Dictionary attack: Make sure all/ most of the words are English 
3. Make sure all letters are accounted for: Make sure the genome contains all of the letters A - Z. 

Breeding program is written
Stage 1 is written, but it seems to converge to a local maximum, so I'm not sure how to get a diverse group of genomes.
